# Jack Handle Pad

The Daytona 3-ton floor jack from Harbor Freight does not come with adequate
padding on the handle. If the metal handle were to bump into a car's body, it
could leave lasting scratches or chips in the paint. To remedy this, an
additional sleeve can be printed out of TPU to add additional cushioning to the
handle.

The existing padding on the handle is Uxcell foam tubing with a 35mm ID and
47mm OD. This padding can be purchased and added to the handle, however, this
could make it difficult to assemble or disassemble the 2-piece handle. The
model provided here has a cutout for the spring-loaded button pin, which allows
the handle to be assembled or disassembled while the padding stays in place.

## Recommended print settings

- Material: TPU or other flexible filament
- Infill: 15%
- Infill Pattern: Gyroid
- Supports: None

Be sure to orient the model in the slicer such that the Z-seam is aligned with
the button pin cutout.
